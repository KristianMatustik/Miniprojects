This repository will contain various small projects, mostly in python, which I created during my studies and free time (currently searching for past projects and finishing a few other). 

They are usually few hours max projects in single file not worthy of own repo (at least untill GitHub adds easy way to group them to folders).

Most are not optimized, have the cleanest code, etc. etc. ..., but they did the job I wanted them to do well enough.
